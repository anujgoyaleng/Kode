# Low-Level Design (LLD) — **Smart Student Hub (Full-Fledged Production System)**

Below is a thorough, implementation-ready LLD for the full product (not a prototype). It covers system components, data model (DDL), APIs (OpenAPI style), auth & RBAC, verification, integrations (LMS/ERP), reporting (NAAC/NIRF), scalability, reliability, security, monitoring, and deploy/CI considerations. Use this as the single reference your devs/architects can implement from.

---

# 1. Goals & Non-Functional Requirements

* **Functional:** Centrally store student academic & co-curricular records, faculty verification, auto-generated verified portfolios, institution analytics & NAAC/NIRF reporting, integrations with LMS/ERP, mobile + web apps.
* **Availability:** 99.9% SLA for core read operations; 99.5% for write/verification workflows.
* **Scalability:** Support millions of records across many HEIs; multi-tenant should be supported.
* **Security & Privacy:** Strong auth (SSO), RBAC, encryption at rest & transit, audit trails, consent for public sharing.
* **Compliance:** Data portability/export, retention policies, and prepare for applicable Indian data/privacy laws.
* **Extensibility:** Modular so verifiable credentials, OCR, ML, and blockchain features can be plugged in later.

External Integrations: LMS/ERP via API Connector | Email/SMS gateway | Verifiable Credentials Provider
```

* **Frontend:** Next.js (SSR for public profile pages), Tailwind CSS, PWA features. Mobile: Flutter for Android+iOS (or React Native).
* **API Layer:** API Gateway (NGINX/Cloud Load Balancer) — routes to microservices (Node.js/NestJS or Spring Boot).
* **Microservices:** Domain split (Users, Activities, Verification, Reporting, Analytics, Integration, Notifications).
* **Persistence:** PostgreSQL as primary relational DB with JSONB columns for flexible metadata; Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for search and NAAC report queries; S3 for files.
* **Messaging:** Kafka (preferred at scale) or RabbitMQ for async workflows (OCR, notifications, verifiable credential issuance).
* **Workers:** Kubernetes CronJobs/worker pods for background tasks (thumbnails, OCR, batch report generation).
* **Observability:** Prometheus + Grafana + Loki for logs; Elastic APM or Jaeger for traces.
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI → Build → Test → Container registry → K8s deployments with Helm.

---

# 3. Multi-Tenant vs Single-Tenant

* **Multi-tenant (recommended):** a `tenant_id` on major tables, per-tenant configuration, role scoping. Helps onboard many institutions.
* **Isolation:** Data partitioning (schema per tenant or row-level tenant\_id). Use row-level with strict queries initially; move to schema isolation for very large tenants.

---

# 4. Data Model (core tables) — Postgres DDL (simplified)

> This DDL is starting point. Add indices, constraints, and FK cascades as needed.

```sql
-- tenants (institutions)
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  domain TEXT,
  config JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- users
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  password_hash TEXT, -- optional if SSO used
  name TEXT,
  role TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'student'|'faculty'|'admin'|'placement'|'verifier'
  college_id TEXT, -- roll no / student id

);

-- student_profiles (extended)
CREATE TABLE student_profiles (

  student_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  title TEXT,
  issuer TEXT,
  issue_date DATE,
  expiry_date DATE,
  proof JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);

-- audit_logs (security & action logs)
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID,
  user_id UUID,
  action TEXT,
  target_type TEXT,
  target_id UUID,
  details JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Indexes:**

* index on `(tenant_id, student_id, status)` for activity queries.
* GIN index on JSONB metadata and skills arrays for flexible search.
* text search index on `title, description` using tsvector.

# 5. API Design — OpenAPI style (selected endpoints)

Use versioned APIs: `/v1/`

### Auth & User

* `POST /v1/auth/login` — email/password (or JWT via SSO).
* `POST /v1/auth/sso/callback` — SAML/OAuth2 SSO integration.
* `POST /v1/auth/impersonate` — admin impersonation (audit logged).

### Students & Profiles

* `GET /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/students/{id}` — get profile.
* `PATCH /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/students/{id}` — update profile.

### Activity Management

* `POST /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/activities` — create activity (multipart for files).
* `GET /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/activities?studentId=&status=&type=&q=&page=&size=` — search/list
* `GET /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/activities/{activityId}` — detail
* `PUT /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/activities/{activityId}` — update
* `DELETE /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/activities/{activityId}` — soft delete

### Verification

* `POST /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/activities/{activityId}/verify` — body: `{action:approve|reject, comment}`
* `GET /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/verifications?activityId=&verifierId=` — audit

### Portfolio & Export

* `GET /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/students/{id}/portfolio?format=pdf|json|link` — generate portfolio; returns presigned URL for PDF or link.
* `POST /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/students/{id}/portfolio/share` — create shareable token with expiry.

### Reporting / Admin

* `GET /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/reports/naac?year=2024` — generate NAAC data payload (JSON) or full PDF.
* `POST /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/reports/naac/export` — trigger async generation (queued) -> returns job id.

### Search / Integration

* `POST /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/integrations/lms/ingest` — inbound webhook for grade/activity sync.
* `GET /v1/tenants/{tenantId}/search?q=&filters=` — search across students/activities (Elasticsearch).

**Security headers**: every request must include `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` and `X-Tenant-Id` for multi-tenant validation (server verifies claims).

---

# 6. Authentication & Authorization

* **Primary Auth:** OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (SSO) integration with institutions (SAML/OAuth2). Use Keycloak/Auth0 or custom OIDC provider.
* **JWTs:** short-lived access tokens (15m), refresh tokens rotating with revocation list.
* **Roles:** student, faculty, admin, verifier, placement\_officer, auditor.
* **Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC):** combine role + attributes (dept, program) for fine-grained permissions.
* **Impersonation:** logged and allowed only for admins (with OTP/consent).
* **RBAC table:** store role mappings per tenant, per user.

---

# 7. Verification Workflow (detailed)

1. Student uploads activity and proof metadata recorded; status = `Pending`.
2. Notification sent to the assigned faculty/mentor (based on department mapping or activity metadata).
3. Faculty opens verification UI, can:

   * Approve: status -> `Verified`, verifications table entry logged, optional verifiable credential issued (async).
   * Reject: status -> `Rejected`, comment required.
   * Request info: status -> `PendingInfo`, triggers student notification.
4. On approval, system:

   * creates audit log entry,
   * optional: sends signed VC (verifiable credential) or issues digital badge,
   * updates search index,
   * increments analytics counters (async via events).
5. All verifier actions create `verifications` entries and `audit_logs` for non-repudiation.

**Design note:** faculty may have bulk verify actions; use batched jobs to process.

---

# 8. Files & Proof Storage

* **Object Storage:** S3 (or compatible). All files stored under `tenant_id/student_id/activity_id/`.
* **Immutability & Hashing:** store SHA256 hash and file metadata for tamper detection.
* **Presigned URLs:** for secure direct upload/download with short expiry.
* **Virus Scanning:** integrate ClamAV / commercial scanning in upload pipeline (async).
* **Thumbnails & OCR:** queued jobs generate thumbnail images and run OCR (Google Vision / Tesseract) to extract text and populate metadata.

---

# 9. Search & Analytics

* **Search engine:** Elasticsearch / OpenSearch for full text, faceted search, and NAAC queries.
* **Indexing:** Activities, student profiles, certifications; keep denormalized index documents for fast queries.
* **Analytics:** mix of:

  * near real-time metrics computed with streaming (Kafka -> consumer -> aggregated metrics in Redis / ClickHouse)
  * periodic batch reports (daily/weekly) computed by Reporting Service and stored as CSV/PDF.
* **BI & Dashboarding:** embed Metabase / Superset for admin dashboards; custom analytics microservice for specialized NAAC exports.

---

# 10. Integration with LMS / ERP / University Systems

* **Connector Patterns:**

  * **Inbound:** LMS/ERP will post events (grades, attendance) to an endpoint. Provide webhook security (HMAC signature + tenant binding).
  * **Outbound:** API & webhooks for ERP to pull reports or update student portfolio links.
  * **Adapters:** Build per-institution adapters (configurable mappers) for common LMS (Moodle, Canvas), ERPs (SAP, Tally?), and university digital platforms (DigiLocker, University API).
* **Data mapping & staging:** Integration Service maps incoming fields -> canonical activity schema, validates, and stores in a staging table for admin review before final insertion.
* **Scheduling:** support scheduled ETLs for systems that only provide daily exports.

---

# 11. Verifiable Credentials & Tamper-Proofing (optional but recommended)

* Use W3C Verifiable Credentials & Decentralized Identifiers (DID) flow:

  * On approve, Verification Service issues a signed credential (JWT or JSON-LD) with issuer private key.
  * Employer or external verifier can validate signature against public DID or institutional DID registry.
* Alternatives: anchor hash of activity record on blockchain (e.g., using a permissioned ledger) for tamper evidence.

---

# 12. Security & Privacy (detailed)

* **Transport:** TLS 1.2+ enforced.
* **Encryption at rest:** DB and object storage encryption.
* **Key Management:** KMS (AWS KMS / GCP KMS) for keys.
* **PII Minimization:** store minimal personal data; provide data export & deletion per student requests.
* **Consent & Sharing:** explicit consent flags (`visibility` JSON) for public portfolios; share tokens with expiry and revocation.
* **Auditability:** all critical actions logged to `audit_logs` and immutable append-only store (or write once).
* **WAF & DDoS:** Web Application Firewall (Cloudflare/AWS WAF).
* **Rate limiting:** per-tenant & per-user, with throttling for heavy APIs like search.
* **Penetration tests:** annual tests, bug bounty for major deployments.
* **Data retention & backup:** policy table that defines retention; scheduled snapshots & cross-region backups.
* **GDPR/India Law readiness:** Provide data portability endpoints + consent logs.

---

# 13. Performance & Scalability Patterns

* **Stateless services behind LB:** scale horizontally.
* **DB scaling:** primary Postgres with read replicas; partitioning/sharding for high scale tenants.
* **Caching:** Redis for session & hot data (student dashboard stats), CDN for static files & portfolio pages.
* **Search scaling:** dedicated Elasticsearch cluster, index per tenant or index aliasing.
* **Queue scaling:** Kafka for high throughput; consumers scale independently.
* **Backpressure:** queue lengths monitored, autoscale workers when backlog rises.

---

# 14. Background Jobs & Topics (Kafka/RabbitMQ)

* **Topics:**

  * `activity.created` — produce when activity inserted.
  * `activity.verified` — produce on approval.
  * `file.uploaded` — for thumbnail & OCR.
  * `report.generate` — for async report jobs.
  * `vc.issue` — verifiable credential issuance.
  * `notification.send` — push/email/SMS.

* **Workers:**

  * FileProcessor: create thumbnails, thumbnails stored on S3.
  * OCRProcessor: run OCR, patch activity metadata.
  * BadgeIssuer: create micro-credentials.
  * ReportGenerator: build NAAC/PDF exports.
  * NotificationWorker: send emails/push/SMS.

---

# 15. Reporting / NAAC, NIRF, AICTE Exports

* Provide templates for NAAC criteria mapping:

  * Predefine required fields (e.g., number of workshops, faculty involvement, student participation).
  * Reporting Service aggregates data by criteria and generates CSV/Excel and printable PDF.
* Exports:

  * `NAAC JSON` — canonical payload to be consumed by college.
  * `PDF / Excel` — human readable for submission.
* Admin UI: allow filters (academic year, dept) and preview before export.

---

# 16. Mobile App Considerations

* **Offline mode:** store activity drafts locally; sync when online.
* **Photo capture:** capture proofs, auto-compress, upload background job with network awareness.
* **Push notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging for approvals/requests.
* **Security:** mobile secure storage for tokens, SSO integration via in-app browser + deep links for SSO callbacks.

---

# 17. Monitoring, Alerting & Observability

* **Metrics:** Prometheus scrape endpoints; Grafana dashboards for latency, error rates, queue backlogs, CPU/memory.
* **Tracing:** Jaeger or OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing of verification flows.
* **Logging:** structured JSON logs to Loki / ELK.
* **SLO & Alerts:** create alerts on 95/99p latency, error rate thresholds, queue backlog > threshold, replication lag.
* **Uptime Probes:** synthetic tests to simulate critical flows (create activity → verify → generate portfolio).

---

# 18. CI/CD, Testing, & Release Strategy

* **CI Pipeline:** lint → unit tests → integration tests (local ephemeral DB via Docker Compose) → build docker images → push to registry.
* **CD Pipeline:** automated deploy to staging -> manual approval -> deploy to prod.
* **Blue/Green or Canary:** use canary releases for major changes; toggle feature flags for risky features.
* **Testing:**

  * Unit tests (Jest, pytest, JUnit).
  * Integration tests (API level).
  * E2E tests (Cypress) for critical user flows.
  * Load testing (k6) for search/report endpoints.
* **Schema migrations:** use Flyway/Hasura or Liquibase; version controlled.

---

# 19. Data Migration & Onboarding Plan

* **Bulk Importer Tool:** admin UI and CLI to upload CSVs of legacy records (students, grades, activities).
* **Staging area:** imported data staged for review; mapping UI to map columns to canonical fields.
* **Validation & Duplicate Detection:** fuzzy matching on student name + college\_id + email.
* **Rollback & Idempotency:** ensure imports are idempotent and have rollback plans.

---

# 20. Backup, Disaster Recovery, Business Continuity

* **Backups:** daily snapshots of DB + continuous WAL archiving; store encrypted backups cross-region.
* **RTO / RPO:** set RTO (<=2h) and RPO (<=1h) for core services.
* **DR drills:** periodic failover tests.
* **Data export:** provide full tenant export for legal/portability requirements.

---

# 21. Sample Sequence: Student Upload -> Faculty Approve -> Portfolio Issued

1. Student (mobile/web) uploads activity via `POST /v1/tenants/{tid}/activities` (multipart).
2. API stores metadata in Postgres, files to S3, produces `activity.created` event.
3. FileProcessor scars thumbnails; OCRProcessor extracts text; SearchIndexer updates index.
4. NotificationWorker sends push/email to assigned faculty.
5. Faculty approves via `POST /verify` -> Verification Service updates activity status, emits `activity.verified`.
6. VC Issuer consumes `activity.verified` and issues verifiable credential (async), storing credential record and optionally emailing student.
7. Portfolio generator uses verified activities to create PDF (via headless Chrome or server HTML -> PDF), stores presigned URL for student to download/share.

---

# 22. API Rate Limits & Quotas

* Per-tenant & per-user rate limits; higher limits for admins.
* Burst allowances with token bucket; throttle heavy endpoints like search/export.

---

# 23. Testing & QA Plan (key flows)

* Unit tests for services & data model.
* Integration tests for end-to-end upload → verify → portfolio generation.
* Security tests: static code analysis, SCA, secret scanning.
* Pen tests on auth flows & file uploads.

---

# 24. Developer Deliverables & Milestones (what to implement first)

1. **Core infra:** tenants, users, auth (SSO), basic UI scaffolding.
2. **Activity CRUD + file upload pipeline** (S3, file metadata).
3. **Verification flow** (faculty queue + audit).
4. **Portfolio generation** (HTML template → PDF).
5. **Search & basic analytics** (Elasticsearch, admin charts).
6. **Integrations:** LMS ingest webhook + CSV importer.
7. **Optional advanced:** OCR, VC issuance, mobile offline.

---

# 25. Operational Considerations & Cost Optimization

* Use managed services (RDS, ElasticSearch Service, S3) to reduce ops overhead.
* Optimize storage by moving old proofs to cold storage.
* Rightsize compute via autoscaling and spot instances for batch workers.

---

# 26. Example: Portfolio HTML Template (fields to include)

* Student header (photo, name, college\_id, program, contact if consented).
* Academic summary (CGPA, semesters, honors).
* Verified Activities (table with title, type, role, organizer, date, hours, proof link).
* Certifications.
* Skills & Badges.
* Verification footer with cryptographic signature or verification URL.

---

# 27. Future Enhancements (roadmap)

* Full VC and DID integration; public registry for validation.
* ML recommendations for placement matching & skill gap analysis.
* University Federation: single sign-on across consortiums.
* Employer API for real-time verification with granular access controls.
* Advanced analytics: cohort tracking, trend dashboards.

---

# 28. Final Notes & Quick Checklist for Implementation Start

* Choose stack: Node.js (NestJS) or Java (Spring) for backend; Next.js for web; Flutter for mobile.
* Finalize multi-tenant model (row-level tenant\_id vs schema).
* Prepare SSO integration plan (most colleges support SAML/OAuth).
* Define NAAC/NIRF required fields early — map DB schema accordingly.
* Keep strong audit & consent models from day one.

If you want, I can now:

* generate the **full SQL DDL** (complete with constraints, FK, indexes),
* produce the **OpenAPI (YAML)** for the endpoints above, or
* scaffold a **microservice directory structure** and example code for `Activity Service` (Node.js + TypeORM) ready to drop into a repo.

Tell me which of these three you want right away and I’ll produce it in the next message.
